Examples for deploying on CastAI

1. Order multi-cloud cluster in https://console.cast.ai, ideally with 3 clouds.

2. Extract Global Load Balancer DNS name, for instance ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.12b6ecc5-ffaa-42a1-a897-4bc00b24dcb8.onmulti.cloud you can locate it Service under Endpoints fields in ingress-nging namespace. You can do this with 


```kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx```
   
   or click on K8s dashboard UI on console.cast.ai, change namespace to ingress-nginx and go to services.

3. Create CNAME in your business DNS zone (shop.example.com) which points to GLB DNS Name from step 2.

4. Modify Ingress resource (very last in yaml file) with CNAME from step 3 in file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CastAI/examples/main/boutique-eshop/boutique-eshop.yaml
```
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - boutique-demo.onmulti.cloud
      secretName: demo-tls
  rules:
    - host: boutique-demo.onmulti.cloud
```    
Should be
```
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - shop.example.com
      secretName: demo-tls
  rules:
    - host: shop.example.com
``` 

5. Apply yaml to multi-cloud K8s cluster from step 4

```kubectl apply -f modified-boutique-eshop.yaml```

6. Go to URL https:// name created in step 3

7. Refresh site several times to demonstrate that Front-end PODs is distributed on 3 clouds.

8. Profit
